Once the circuit has been created, youâ€™ll need to open the RYG.ino file in Arduino and compile, then upload it. 
This is just a simple script that will change the LEDs over every second and make sure that the circuit is correct.
Around this point you should note the COM port the Arduino is on (Tools/Serial Port).

 

int gLed = 10; //corresponds to Pin 10 on the Arduino
int yLed = 11; // Pin 11
int rLed = 12; // Pin 12

void setup() {
pinMode(gLed, OUTPUT); //Sets all the LED pins to Output on start up
pinMode(yLed, OUTPUT);
pinMode(rLed, OUTPUT);

digitalWrite(gLed, LOW);//turns all LEDs off.
digitalWrite(yLed, LOW);
digitalWrite(rLed, LOW);
}

void loop() {

digitalWrite(gLed, HIGH); //turns Green on
delay(1000); // Waits a second
digitalWrite(gLed, LOW); //Green off
digitalWrite(yLed, HIGH); // Yellow on
delay(1000); // Waits a second
digitalWrite(yLed, LOW); // Yellow Off
digitalWrite(rLed, HIGH); //Red On
delay(1000);
digitalWrite(rLed, LOW);
}
